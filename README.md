Edmunds Project: For this project I used a predictive model using python to get a feature set on the dependent attributes of the BMW Series 3 on Edmunds.com. After getting a feature set I evaluated P-value to see if the feature had predictive value in determinging the price of the vehicle. My top features for this project were Engine Model whether the car had the Sport Package, Parking Assist, Cold Weather Package, Blind Spot detection and the number of miles and years old.
